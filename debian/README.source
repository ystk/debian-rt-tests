Problems when building rt-tests from the git repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compared to the upstream's .tar.gz the upstream's git repo doesn't contain the
ChangeLog file but has a file rt-tests.spec-in.  So if the .diff.gz is
generated from the git repository, it adds the rt-tests.spec-in file.
(dpkg-source only warns about Changlog, but doesn't add a hunk for it.) I
don't know a nice way to prevent this, apart from accepting it or edit the
diff by hand.

So I always build using the orig.tar.gz.  See debian/build for a helper script.
